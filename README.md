# cable-segmentation
This work is part of my student research project at the University of Stuttgart IFF and Fraunhofer IPA, which is about 3D position determination of cables based on 3D point cloud segmentation in disassembly processes.
This repo is about routines for point cloud analysis using pointnet2 and stratified transformer.
